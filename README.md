# The exercise - Develop a CUI e-commerce system

# System description
In this exercise we will run an e-commerce system. We will keep its name and the system of users for the system. For each user we will save his username, login password and residential address. Each user is either a seller or a buyer (there is no one who is both a seller and a buyer). For the seller all the feedback received from the customers should be kept in addition so that each feedback contains information about the feedback giver, the feedback date and verbal assessment. Also, keep all the products he sells for him. No need to manage inventory. For each buyer we will keep the shopping cart that contains the products that the customer has selected and has not yet ordered. Each product belongs to a certain category (children, electricity, office and clothing), it has a unique name, price and serial number in the system (the same product at different sellers will have a different serial number) When a customer places an order, he can only choose products that are in his shopping cart . For the order we will keep the product items, the total order price, the seller details and the buyer details. When paying for the order the items will be removed from the buyer's shopping cart.
